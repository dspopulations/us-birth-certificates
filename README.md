### Prerequisites

#### Fitting models

To fit models, a recent Python installation is required. Some of our dependencies are best installed from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), for which either [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) or [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) is required.

Then, to install Python dependencies, from the repository root:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml
